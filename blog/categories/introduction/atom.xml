    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Hello World</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Its been a long time procrastinating to write a blog. Having read this <a href="www.writerbabu.com/post.php?post_id=554">post</a>, I realized that I really need to think about the progress I am doing each day. I will be creating a new post every two days, in the worst case, with something that I have learnt or something that I know. Writing about something you know, really questions your assumptions, and you realize that you really didn&rsquo;t know something that well. Its also been a long time that I wrote essays, and I am feeling rusty. It is reflected in the way that I am writing this post. It is high time that I improve my writing skills also. Hopefully I will imprve over time</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I put a lot of effort to get this blog running. I feel really powerful as I can configure this blog as I want it to be and more than anything, it has <strong>MathJax</strong> support. I think this will help me to express my views better.</p>
