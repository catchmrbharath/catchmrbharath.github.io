Its been a long time procrastinating to write a blog. Having read this [post](www.writerbabu.com/post.php?post_id=554), I realized that I really need to think about the progress I am doing each day. I will be creating a new post every two days, in the worst case, with something that I have learnt or something that I know. Writing about something you know, really questions your assumptions, and you realize that you really didn't know something that well. Its also been a long time that I wrote essays, and I am feeling rusty. It is reflected in the way that I am writing this post. It is high time that I improve my writing skills also. Hopefully I will imprve over time

I put a lot of effort to get this blog running. I feel really powerful as I can configure this blog as I want it to be and more than anything, it has **MathJax** support. I think this will help me to express my views better.
