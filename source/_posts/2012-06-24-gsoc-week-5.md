This week has been mostly bug fixing and working on migrating the sympy ipython profile to sympy. I also wanted to add the functionality of `ipython -c qtconsole`. So it has been mostly hanging in the ipython irc, asking them lots of questions on how ipython works. I am really thankful to minrk who patiently taught me how to do most of the stuff. There are a few problems that I am facing, but I think I will have the qtconsole ready in a day.

I also submitted a pull request #1370 for my initial work on implicit plotting. Except for the bug of changing line thickness, it works pretty nicely. Please feel free to play with it and comment on the pull request if you encounter any bugs.
