I recently got gifted the book Structure and Interpretation of Programs(SICP) on my birthday.
I have had a long desire to go through the complete book and complete all the exercises. Inspired
by [Eli Bendersky's](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/), I am going to spend the next 6 months or maybe
a year going through the book. I have already finished the first chapter of the book. Hence I will
be blogging only from chapter 2. I am going to follow the plan laid out by Eli Bendersky, the plan being

* Read the book
* See all the video lectures by Sussman and Abelson
* Do **all** the exercises in the book.
* Write about the exercises and the things that I have learnt from it.
