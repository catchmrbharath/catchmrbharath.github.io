  I am a Masters student in Computer Science at University of California, San Diego. I am mostly a self taught programmer, doing my first few computer science
  courses now.I love to work on cool things at the intersection of Applied Math and Computer Science. I love the fact that Math and Computer Science, when applied to a particular field, can revolutionize the field of study.
  My present interest are in machine learning and scientific computing. I am discovering a lot of topics in computer science right now, and I have a developed an interest in
  distributed systems and theory of programming languages.
